            <h3 class="text-center">This is our brainstorming time. It looks like this:</h3>
            <p>Students are given 4 post-it notes.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>3 are for project ideas. Ex:to-do list, mad-lib generator, etc...</li>
              <li>1 is for a project add-on. Ex: "that makes animal sounds"</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Spend 3 minutes writing down ideas for projects you would like to see built</p>
            <p>Each student then gets 3 minutes to eplain their ideas to the group as they place their post-its on the board/table (Keeping add ons hidden)</p>
            <p>Once all ideas have been explained and put on display, the group goes through 3 rounds of voting to wittle down the ideas to one working project.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Each person gets two votes (add-ons are not included in this round). At the end of this round of voting, any ideas without at least 2 votes are removed.</li>
              <li>Each person get 1 vote. Idea with the most votes wins. If there is a tie, vote again amoungst the tied ideas.</li>
              <li>Add-ons are voted on. 1 vote per person. Most votes wins. Tie breakers as necessary.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><i>This seems like a really dumb system, oh well</i></p>
            <p>Combine project and add-on, this is what we're building</p>
            <h1 class="text-center">0:30 - 1:00</h1>
            <h3 class="text-center">Scoping Time</h3>
            <p>Make quick wireframes and write scope document</p>
            <p>Assign rolls to folks</p>
            <h1 class="text-center">1:00 - 2:00</h1>
            <h3 class="text-center">First Build Hour</h3>
